# Data Storytelling

This repository showcases some of the presentations and reports I have given. Communication should be deeply ingrained in every data scientist's day-to-day life, and I continue to discover new ways of presenting data very often. Below are some details of the examples in the repository. These examples are not bound under NDAs, and all identifiable information have been redacted.

* A [report](https://github.com/jenliketen/data_storytelling/blob/main/report_for_statisticians.pdf) to fellow statisticians about the findings to how hormone therapy impacts health outcomes in women: contains various statistical terms and metrics to robustly support conclusions

* A [board presentation](https://github.com/jenliketen/data_storytelling/blob/main/board_presentation.pdf) to C-suite management: contains short bullet points and many simple images and animations to simplify complex concepts in data science and how they drive business decisions

* An [infrastructure guide](https://github.com/jenliketen/data_storytelling/blob/main/guide_for_interns.pdf) to interns I lead: contains exclusively screenshots and annotations to ensure clarity and reproducibility
