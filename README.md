# Data Storytelling

This repository showcases some of the presentations and reports I have given. Communication should be deeply ingrained in every data scientist's day-to-day life, and I continue to discover new ways of presenting data very often. Below are some details of the examples in the repository. These examples are not bound under any NDAs.

* A report to fellow statisticians about the findings to how hormone therapy impacts health outcomes in women: contains various statistical terms and metrics to robustly support conclusions

* A board presentation to C-suite management: contains short bullet points and many simple images and animations to simplify complex concepts in data science and how they drive business decisions

* An AWS infrastructure guide to interns I lead: contains exclusively screenshots and annotations to ensure clarity and reproducibility
